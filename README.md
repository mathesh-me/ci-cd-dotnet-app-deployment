# .NET Application with Jenkins CI/CD 🚀

## Project Overview 🎉
Deploying a .NET application with a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

## Project Description 📋

This project demonstrates how to deploy a .NET application with a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline includes automated testing, Docker image management, and local development.

## Workflow Diagram 📊
// Diagram will be added soon

## Prerequisites 📋

Ensure you have the following prerequisites before getting started:

- A virtual machine or EC2 instance with the following installed:
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/)
  - [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.18.3/installation/)
- A code for the .NET application hosted on GitHub.

## Features 

- **Automated Testing:** Utilize Trivy, SonarQube, and OWASP Dependency Check for comprehensive code testing.
- **Docker Image Management:** Build, scan, and push Docker images seamlessly.
- **Jenkins Integration:** Streamline development with an integrated Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
- **Local Development:** Easily trigger local builds using the Docker image generated by the pipeline.

## CI/CD Pipeline Overview 📋

1. **Checkout Code:**
   - Automatically fetches the latest code from the GitHub repository.

2. **Testing:**
   - Employs Trivy, SonarQube, and OWASP Dependency Check for thorough code testing.

3. **Docker Image Build:**
   - Utilizes a Makefile to build Docker images.

4. **Docker Image Scan:**
   - Trivy scans Docker images for vulnerabilities.

5. **Docker Image Push:**
   - Pushes the Docker image to a designated repository.

6. **Local Build:**
   - Enables developers to trigger local builds using the generated Docker image.
